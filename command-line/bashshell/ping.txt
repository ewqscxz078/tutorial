ping
	1. ping 127.0.0.1
	2. ping LOCAL IP
	3. ping gateway
	4. ping remote ip

	6. telnet remote TCP PORT

Ping: You can test if a network connection exists by pinging the other computer.
	Open a command prompt
	Type “ping <Remote Machine Name or IP address>” and press enter.
	Telnet: You should also test the connection using telnet as this allows you to specify the TCP port.

Open a command prompt
	Type in "telnet <IP ADDRESS OF SERVER PC> <PORT>" and press enter.
	For example, we would type “telnet 192.168.1.100 21379”
	If a blank screen appears then the port is open, and the test is successful.
	If you receive a connecting... message or an error message then something is blocking that port.
	It could be the Windows firewall, a third party firewall like Norton's or a hardware firewall between the PCs.
