try 優化變數處理

Before Java 9, we could only use fresh variables inside a try-with-resources block:
	try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"));
		PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("testWrite.txt"))) {
		// omitted
	}

After Java 9
	final Scanner scanner = new Scanner(new File("testRead.txt"));
	PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new File("testWrite.txt"))
	try (scanner;writer) {
		// omitted
	}
